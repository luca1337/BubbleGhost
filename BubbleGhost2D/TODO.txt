//THIS IS THE TODO LIST THAT SHOW WHAT ARE THE CHANGES THE GAME NEEDS TO TAKE IN ORDER TO WORKS GOOD.

PLAYER RELATED ISSUES:
1) Make player flip when changing direction ex(right or left) => just call sprite.Flipx();
2) Fix player rotation when it's out of ball's radius, it needs to lerp to initial position,
to rotate player, i'm using Sin and Cos to know the rotation based to target entity so that might
be the problem.
3) The ball texture has some problem so might need to change it or restore the old one. ( our choice )
4) General code-refactoring

GAME ADDONS:
<<The code already support level managing but we have to make it works for other gameObjects like coolingfan, 
candle etc.. so need to adapt it to tileMap, that might need a code fix>>

1) Add more animated gameobjects in scene like candle, coolingfan which spread the blow toward a direction.
2) Add more levels.
3) Player need to be animated when it loses or he wins with it's own animation.
3) Add a game-Logic :P

GENERAL CHANGES:
1) Add input library to replace standart api keyevents handler.

#Happy coding ^^
